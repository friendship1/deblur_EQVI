## Experimental Results
Our algorithm is motivated by the success of variational model-based methods. It explores sharpness pixels from adjacent frames by a temporal sharpness prior (see (f)) and restores sharp videos by a cascaded inference process. As our analysis shows, enforcing the temporal sharpness prior in a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and learning the deep CNN by a cascaded inference manner can make the deep CNN more compact and thus generate better-deblurred results than both the CNN-based methods [27, 32] and variational model-based method [12].

We further train the proposed method to convergence, and get higher PSNR/SSIM than the result reported in the paper.  

Quantitative results on the benchmark dataset by Su et al. [24]. All the restored frames instead of randomly selected 30 frames from each test set [24] are used for evaluations. *Note that: Ours * is the result that we further trained to convergence, and Ours is the result reported in the paper.*

### Dataset Organization Form
If you prepare your own dataset, please follow the following form:
```
|--dataset  
    |--blur  
        |--video 1
            |--frame 1
            |--frame 2
                ：  
        |--video 2

                ：  
        |--video 2
        	:
        |--video n
```

### Training
- Download the PWC-Net pretrained model.
- Download training dataset, or prepare your own dataset like above form.
- Run the following commands:
```
cd ./code
python main.py --save path/to/save --dir_data path/to/train/dataset --dir_data_test path/to/val/dataset --epochs 500 --batch_size 8
	# --save: the experiment result will be in './experiment/save'.
